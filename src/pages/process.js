              <h2>Quotation</h2>
              <p>After receiving customer requirements we contact potential suppliers and narrow them down to find the ones that we believe will have the best prices. Through this process we also will gain an understanding of what costs might be incurred for customers later on, when ordering samples, for instance.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="col-lg-3 process">
              <p className="number">2</p>
              <h2>Samples</h2>
              <p>Our next step is to purchase samples from the supplier. These samples and any relevant documents are sent to our facilities where quality control checks are performed by a professional team. Itâ€™s also possible for us to consolidate multiple samples and ship them to clients.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="col-lg-3 process">
              <p className="number">3</p>
              <h2>Negotiation</h2>
              <p>After generating feedback about the samples, we prepare to negotiate the unit price for mass production with suppliers. At this stage we already know of several credible suppliers, and this helps us in negotiations. Our goal is to get the best quality for the price being paid for the products.</p>

            <div class="col-lg-3 process">
              <p className="number">4</p>
              <h2>Payment</h2>
              <p>Payment is negotiated with the supplier and a downpayment is typically made to us at this point. By passing payment through us, clients can have a guarantee that defects are reduced to a minimum, products match specifications, and that the quantity shipped is correct. It is relatively easy to negotiate with suppliers because goods have not been shipped overseas yet.</p>

              <p className="number">5</p>
              <h2>Manufacturing</h2>
              <p>During manufacturing, we can employ a variety of different methods to ensure that the products are produced according to specification. This can range from regular communication with the supplier to on-site audits.</p>

              <p className="number">6</p>
              <h2>Inspection</h2>
              <p>Inspection post-production can be done through random sampling or 100% inspection, depending on the product and requirements. We can also arrange for inspections to be done at our facilities.</p>

              <p>Shipping can be done through express, air freight or sea freight. We can help customers to select the appropriate shipping method and deal with customs if necessary. </p>
